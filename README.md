The goal of this project is to explore how electoral outcomes for regional councils can be optimized using the Simulated Annealing algorithm. The project involves finding the best configuration for electoral districts by making changes to the districts' boundaries, specifically by moving counties between neighboring electoral districts. This is achieved through a console application that interfaces with an MS SQL Server database.
